# Fisherman

This is a decompression fishing game that I made in 3 days for pygame-community-summer-jam-2023.

The gameplay is relatively simple, you need to click on the fish on the screen to catch them in order to get money. Different fish have different abilities, and some fish cannot be caught.

## About the game jam

### Theme
**Waterworld/Water**

Fish grow in water, so it fits the theme "water".

### Challenge
**Small**

The game contains many small details to improve the user experience, and the game is small too.
